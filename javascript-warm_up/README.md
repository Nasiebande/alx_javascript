JavaScript - Warm up
JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language primarily used for web development. It allows you to add interactivity, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and create dynamic web application.

Summary of JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language.
It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs in the web browser of the user.
JavaScript is commonly used for adding functionality to websites, creating web applications, and enhancing user experiences.

Writing JavaScript Code:

JavaScript code can be embedded directly within HTML documents using <script> tags, or it can be included from external script files. 

Example of inline JavaScript within an HTML file:

<script>
  // JavaScript code here
  alert('Hello, World!');
</script>

Example of linking an external JavaScript file:

<script src="myscript.js"></script>

Basic JavaScript Syntax:

JavaScript uses semicolons ; to terminate statements, but they are often optional.
Variables are declared using let, const, or var.
Functions are declared using the function keyword.
Conditional statements like if, else if, and else are used for branching logic.
Loops like for and while are used for repetitive tasks.
Objects and arrays are fundamental data structures in JavaScript.
